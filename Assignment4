*** Hey you are a chemist from India and you work with degree celsius in your day to day life but due to a project your company had collaborated with a MNC company,
where the chemists use degree frainite for their purposes, and to maintain collaboration consistent we want to have a easy degree conversion, 

Please develop a python based degree converter which takes °C value and give you output of °F 


Input :

°C -> 50

Output :

°F -> 122 

Formula for Conversion :

___°C × 9/5) + 32 = ___°F ***


```
# Assignment 4 (Final Project)
# Temprature Converter

print("Welcome to the Temperature Converter")

temp = eval(input("Enter the Temperature : "))
converted_temp = (temp * 9/5) + 32

print("Temperature Entered           : ",temp,'\N{DEGREE SIGN}C')
print("Converted Temperature is : ",converted_temp,'\N{DEGREE SIGN}F') ```
